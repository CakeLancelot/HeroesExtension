# Definitions
These files are required in order to run the extension. They can be downloaded from Turner's CDN by running the following command in this folder:

```shell
wget -i definitions.txt
```

## What?
FFH's definitions are XML files that contain data, mainly pertaining to:

* Missions
* Actors
  - Heroes
  - Enemies
  - Breakables
  - Bosses
* Effects
* Stats

Note: Not all this data is used server side, but may be loaded anyways for ease of development.

## Versions
Compatibility with older definitions is not guaranteed, but you can still grab them if you wish. 
Simply swap the datecode in the URLs with one of the following:

```
20130221
20130305
20130313
20130320
20130321
20130327
20130509
20130619
20130701
```
